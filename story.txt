This is the story of Deoxyribose and Ribo. The two boys are in love with
biology and can't wait for the next school year. The only problem is that 
they can't seem to understand DNA and RNA (crazy right?).

Deoxyribose and Rbo were really struggling to understand DNA and RNA. This
was tough for them since everybody else somehow got it very quickly. They
decided to talk to one of their friends in the class and find out 
everything they could on the two subjects they were struggling with so
that they could do well in the class.

Their friend, Amine, said that they would explain everything, and Dexoyribose 
and Ribo got quite excited, but Amine does very well in biology. He started by 
explaining the structure of the two, how DNA has two strands connected and RNA 
only has one. This was shocking to them, but it seemed very interesting. Why 
would that be? Amine continued explaining to them.


*FOR YASH*


Finally, after learning all about genetics the three friends decided to go 
grab some ice cream and spent the rest of the day having fun and enjoying the 
outside.

The End
